# About this repo

These templates are from [atcoder library](https://github.com/atcoder/ac-library). And I decided to seperate every part out individually.

## Why I want to create this repo?

The [expander.py](https://github.com/atcoder/ac-library/blob/db0826383c5a6c909f8eac58e64a45aadd4867e2/expander.py) released by the official works good (since the combined file could execute properly). However, I found out that some of the templates are too long due to many lines of comment, so I decided to make them more concise and neat.

## How did I "clean" them?

First I use [expander.py](https://github.com/atcoder/ac-library/blob/db0826383c5a6c909f8eac58e64a45aadd4867e2/expander.py) to get the desired template.

Then I use [Remove Comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=plibither8.remove-comments) extension in VS Code to remove comments and [a small](https://sunnylife.io/en/how-to-remove-empty-lines-in-visual-studio-code/) trick to remove empty lines.

However, some of the empty lines are indomitable so I have to remove them manually.
